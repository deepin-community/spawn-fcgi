spawn-fcgi (1.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  spawn-fcgi now interprets the mode (-M) always as octal integer (same
  as chmod). Also it will always set the mode (for Unix domain sockets,
  not TCP); the default will remove the executable bits and read+write
  access for others (in addition to umask restrictions).

  If you want others to be able to connect to your Unix domain socket,
  you have to manually specify -M 0666 (or better: create a shared
  group, or spawn as root and use the -u and -U options)
